    The series begins with the execution of Gol D. Roger, a man known as the King of the Pirates (海賊王 Kaizokuō). 
    Just before his death, Roger announces that his treasure, the One Piece (ひとつなぎの大秘宝 (ワンピース) Wan Pīsu), 
    will be available to anyone who finds it, causing the Great Pirate Era (大海賊時代 Dai Kaizoku Jidai) to begin.
